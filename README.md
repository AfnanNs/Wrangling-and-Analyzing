# Wrangling-and-Analyzing Project

### Dataset 
The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known 
as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous 
comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. 

## Summary
 In this project I have gathered the data from different sources and format then assess the data visually and programmatically and documenting each quality
 and tidiness issues, after that cleaning these issues by defining them first then write the code to clean and test. By the end, we started analyzing and 
 display our visualization and communicate our insights.
